# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Purpose
This project intends to visualize the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location on the earth. All earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 were also displayed on a map. A dark mode map was also included to give the user the option to view three type sof maps: street, satellite, and dark. The project involves using the d3 library and JavaScript with the URL for GeoJSON earthquake data.
